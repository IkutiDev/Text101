  storyText: "You managed to get out just before the big explosion and your ship turned
    into big flaming heap of rubbish. But you are alive, so it\u2019s not all bad.
    Now it\u2019s time to scout out the unknown, beautiful but probably dangerous
    planet, to see if there is anyone to help or better yet, any spaceships that could
    help you get out of here.\n\n1.Climb one of the nearby hills to have better view
    of the area.\r\n2.Scout out nearby grassland for any signs of humans/humanoids."
